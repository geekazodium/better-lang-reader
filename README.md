# Better lang reader

## Summary

"Lang files with less crong"
basically this allows you to have more organized lang files such as:
```json:
    {
        "something":{
            "thing":"thingy"
        }   
    }
```
and to use get "thingy", you can use the usual TranslatableText for "something.thing"
